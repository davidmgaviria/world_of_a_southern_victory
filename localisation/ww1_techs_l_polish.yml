GER_ww1_infantry2_equip:0 "Zaadoptowanie stahlhelmu"

ww1_infantry2_equip:0 "Nowe hełmy piechoty"

ww1_infantry2_equip_desc:0 "The hats and leather caps that have been assigned to our infantry are simply no longer suitable for modern warfare, and attempts to simply bolster these types of headware have had limited success. By adopting a new helmet, one made out of steel, we certainly won't be able to stop a bullet with any consistency, but our troops will be able to avoid casual head injuries much more easily."


ww1_ambulance1:0 "Ambulans zaprzęgowy"
ww1_ambulance1_desc:0 "With the advent of modern horse-drawn vehicles in our army, we're able to standardize an ambulance vehicle, to quickly escort casualties off of the front line and into quick treatment. While they'll surely have a bumpy ride, and the conditions in these carts won't be particularly pleasant, it is surely much better than having wound treatment in the middle of an artillery crater."
ww1_ambulance2:0 "Ambulans zmotoryzowany"
ww1_ambulance2_desc:0 "Replacing horse-drawn ambulance carts with motor vehicles will allow us to evacuate troops from the battle much more quickly, which will help us save lives when time is of the essence. The improved horsepower vehicles will also allow for smoother rides and the ambulance to carry more supplies more effectively, which will further increase our return on casualties."

ww1_oil1:0 "Wydobycie ropy"
ww1_oil1_desc:0 "Oil and its uses have been known since the late 19th century, and sadly, most of our oil extraction ability dates much the same. Modernizing our oil wells will increase our take of this valuable substance to a good degree."
ww1_oil2:0 "Ulepszone wydobycie ropy"
ww1_oil2_desc:0 "Oil is elusive- it hides underground, where none can see it. For this reason, it's imperitive that we develop more efficient ways to locate it. By improving our oil drilling capabilities, we can find and, therefore, exploit more oil around existing reserves."
ww1_oil3:0 "Szkolenie pracowników"
ww1_oil3_desc:0 "With the recent advances in the tools to find and extract oil, we cannot let our workers be the reason our efforts fall behind. By establishing training standards for oil field workers in both the private and public sector, we can make sure less oil is wasted, further bolstering our newfound reserves of black gold."

ww1_bergiusprocess:0 "Metoda Bergiusa"
ww1_bergiusprocess_desc:0 "The Bergius Process is a method of production of liquid hydrocarbons for use as synthetic fuel by hydrogenation of high-volatile bituminous coal at high temperature and pressure."

ww1_tools3:0 "Zaawansowane narzędzia ręczne"
ww1_tools3_desc:0 "Even old pharoah Menes would have been familiar with the hammer and nail, but modern industries allow us to produce more, superior, and standardized tools, allowing increased productivity in our workshops and industries around the world- so long as they can find that damned 8mm wrench..."


ww1_fortification1:0 "Prace Vaubana nad fortyfikacjami"
ww1_fortification1_desc:0 "Fortifications seem like a no-brainer to construct, and to a degree, this much is the case. However, effective design and positioning of forts is important to get any serious use out of them, and Vauban's Works, despite being published hundreds of years ago, still ring true to this day. Studying this will allow superior fortification construction."

ww1_fortification2:0 "Okopy"
ww1_fortification2_desc:0 "Forts on their own are nice, but in today's Trench Warfare, integrating them into our existing trench systems would be even better. Construction of smaller forts that are interlocked with our trenches will not only give us superior forts, but also give troops in the garrison a far easier way out if need be."

ww1_fortification3:0 "Wzmocniony beton"
ww1_fortification3_desc:0 "Even the substance we construct our fortifications out of can still yet be improved. Reinforcing our concrete will lead to more stable, solid fortifications, less vulnerable to enemy artillery strikes."

ww1_fortification3b:0 "Bunkry obronne"
ww1_fortification3b_desc:0 "Forty same w sobie są dobrym sposobem obrony, ale nie mamy zbyt wiele miejsca ani czasu na ich zbudowanie, gdy linia okopów ciągle sie przemieszcza. Bunkry, będąc mniejszymi i szybszymi do budowy, mogą pomóc naszym liniom obronnym w wzmocnionych sektorach zachować bezpieczeństwo."

ww1_fortification5:0 "Bunkry obronne II"
ww1_fortification5_desc:0 "Forty same w sobie są dobrym sposobem obrony, ale nie mamy zbyt wiele miejsca ani czasu na ich zbudowanie, gdy linia okopów ciągle sie przemieszcza. Bunkry, będąc mniejszymi i szybszymi do budowy, mogą pomóc naszym liniom obronnym w wzmocnionych sektorach zachować bezpieczeństwo."

ww1_fortification6:0 "Bunkry obronne III"
ww1_fortification6_desc:0 "Forty same w sobie są dobrym sposobem obrony, ale nie mamy zbyt wiele miejsca ani czasu na ich zbudowanie, gdy linia okopów ciągle sie przemieszcza. Bunkry, będąc mniejszymi i szybszymi do budowy, mogą pomóc naszym liniom obronnym w wzmocnionych sektorach zachować bezpieczeństwo."

ww1_fortification4:0 "Budowa dział przeciwlotniczych"
ww1_fortification4_desc:0 "The advent of Aircraft provide a new, quite difficult challenge to deal with when constructing fortification lines. It is a lot more difficult to build around a falling bomb than even, say, an artillery shell. Anti-Aircraft guns, therefore, should be set up to support our forts, and keep them defensible even in the modern war."




ww1_medicine1:0 "Nowe instrumenty chirurgiczne"
ww1_medicine1_desc:0 "The era of surgery being a matter of bonesaws and booze is over, thank god. New instruments like the Hirtz Compass and new techniques for existing instruments like Intravenous Blood Transfusion should help to save several of our boys on the battlefield."

ww1_medicine2:0 "Medycyna wojenna"
ww1_medicine2_desc:0 "Bullets are not the only deadly force in combat. The grim taxman of death is well known to take his due toll on soldiers, especially in the stagnant Trench Warfare. Ensuring mass production of vitamins, antibiotics, and other chemical cures- and of course, making sure that they all work as intended- will lead to far less easily preventable casualties for our troops."

ww1_medicine3:0 "Próby sterylizacji"
ww1_medicine3_desc:0 "No, don't worry, we're not starting a national vasectomy campaign. Part of the horror of war is filth- the image of a surgeon arm-deep in a patient with blood from another man on his hands is common, but not good. Ensuring there are appropritate sanitation measures taken for our medics can stop them from doing more harm than good."

ww1_medicine4:0 "Kampania szczepieniowa"
ww1_medicine4_desc:0 "No one enjoys getting a shot, but on the battlefield, being immunized to common diseases could save your life- no sick soldier fights well, after all. Though vaccination is still not yet fully understood, we know enough about the science to know that it's got direct, positive benefits- and who could resist saving more manpower?"

ww1_medicine5:0 "Modernizacja szpitali"
ww1_medicine5_desc:0 "Though our field surgeons are now all well and good, we cannot forget our proper hospitals behind the lines. Ensuring that these men have everything they need to deal with all possible comers suffering afflictions from shell shock to gas wounds, and even, perhaps, perform reconstructive surgery or other wild new techniques, will lead to even more men surviving a close encounter of the front lines."

hoi4tgw_decryption:0 "Deszyfrowanie - Kryptoanaliza"
hoi4tgw_decryption_desc:0 "Decryption is the reverse, in other words, moving from the unintelligible ciphertext back to plaintext."

hoi4tgw_encryption:0 "Szyfrowanie - Kryptografia"
hoi4tgw_encryption_desc:0 "Until modern times, cryptography referred almost exclusively to encryption, which is the process of converting ordinary information into unintelligible text."
