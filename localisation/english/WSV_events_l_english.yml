 wsv_intro.1.t:0 "Introduction" 
 wsv_intro.1.d:0 "Welcome to World of a Southern Victory!  This mod is an adaptation of Harry Turtledove’s “Southern Victory” series, and attempts to replicate the canonical events of the series while also giving players some flexibility in how events play out.  Keep in mind that due to being a one-man team, I have had to focus my efforts on developing content for North America, and have thus neglected aspects of the European nations.  Furthermore, as there is already a World War II mod for Southern Victory, I focused my work more on the Great War section of this mod.  However, I hope to be able to create content for Europe and the Second Great War some time in the future.\n\nI would also like to acknowledge the Wolferos Great War mod, on which this mod is built upon, as well as Kaiserreich, Road to 56, and the Great War Redux, which I have taken some content and ideas from."

 wsv_intro.2.t:0 "Scripted Peace Deals" 
 wsv_intro.2.d:0 "In order to mirror the events of the novels as closely as possible, I have included the canonical peace deals of the series for the Great War.  Although I understand these may limit the freedom of the players, I felt it was the best way to represent the series in game.  However, to maintain flexibility, I have also included an alt-alt history peace deal for the Confederacy winning in the Great War, as well as the OTL peace deals of World War I for the Central Powers.  In the future I hope to expand these peace deals into the Second Great War."

 wsv_intro.3.t:0 "A Note on Deals" 
 wsv_intro.3.d:0 "Due to the being a one-man team, this mod is not compatible with most DLCS.  Specifically, it is NOT compatible with either La Resistance, Man the Guns, No Step Back, and By Blood Alone.  Thus, if you see tech issues with either tanks, the aircraft, or navy, you likely have one of these DLCS enabled.  The other HoI4 DLCS (Waking the Tiger, Death Before Dishonor, and Together for Victory) may work with the mod, but compatibility is not guaranteed."

 wsv_usa.1.t:0 "Remembrance Day"
 wsv_usa.1.d:0 "As another April 22 dawns, the United States once again mourns the day of Remembrance.  All across the nations, solemn parades are held, the American flag waving upside down to mark the distress of the people.  Hundreds of thousands of men in uniform march silently; behind them the veterans of the Second Mexican War and the War of Secession follow.  For those outside the U.S. these yearly parades have become a strange almost cult-like ritual.  But for the American people, it is a reminder of what has been lost, and a promise of retribution against those who took it."
 wsv_usa.1.a:0 "We will avenge that which we have lost"
 wsv_usa.2.t:0 "State of U.S. Politics"
 wsv_usa.2.d:0 "The current state of U.S. politics is complex.  Although the Democrats have mantained a monopoly on power for the past 30 years, the Socialists have now secured a sizeable delegation in Congress--placing them as our main rivals.  In an attempt to force us to negociate, they are now blocking many of our bills, including ones on military spending.  Some Democrats, such as Theodore Roosevlt, argue we should negociate with the Socialists.  Others still suggest that by strengthing the influence of the Army, we could possibly bypass our rivals all together..."

 wsv_usa.3.d:0 "The end of 1912 brings another presidential election.  Although the Socialists have been growing in popularity in recent years, the Democrats are all but assured to win the election.  However, who will lead the Democrat party is a different matter all together.  On one hand there is Theodore Roosevelt, who is by all accounts a true patriot, but nevertheless seeks to work with the socialists in helping the working class.  On the other side is Leonard Wood, who is an even more ardent nationalist than Roosevelt, and holds nothing but contempt for the Socialists.  Who should it be...?"

 wsv_usa.4.d:0 "Theodore Roosevelt has become the new President of the United States.  A towering figure in U.S. politics, Roosevelt is known for his populist pro-labour stance, as well as being an ardent American nationalist.  He also served with distinction in the Second Mexican War, beating back a Canadian assault in the far West.  Now has president, he promises to not let the British or Confederates push the U.S. around one bit."
 wsv_usa.4.a:0 "A political shake up"
 wsv_usa.5.t:0 "Leonard Wood Becomes President of the U.S."
 wsv_usa.5.d:0 "U.S. Army General Leonard Wood has become the new President of the United States.  Running as the Democrat candidate, he swept the election, much to the chagrin of the Socialists in the United States and abroad.  Now in office, he seems poised to expand the size of the U.S. Army, though whether he plans to do this by legal means or otherwise is yet to be seen..."

 wsv_usa.6.t:0 "Strikes!"
 wsv_usa.6.d:0 "Discontent with the labor conditions, workers have gone on strike, demanding better pay.  Although simply ignoring the strikes may make them go away, more likely than not we will have to act."

 wsv_usa.6.c:0 "Send in the army"
 wsv_usa.7.t:0 "Strikes End"
 wsv_usa.7.d:0 "Through a combination of stalling, concessions, and force, the strikes have been broken up, and the workers have returned to work."
 wsv_usa.7.a:0 "Finally"
 wsv_usa.9.t:0 "Review the Naval Budget"
 wsv_usa.9.d:0 "The time has come to review the spending allocated for the navy.  Should we splurge on the latest ships and guns, cut back spending drastically, or meet somewhere in the middle?"
 wsv_usa.9.a:0 "Spare no expense!"

 wsv_usa.10.d:0 "Despite our promises to punish the Confederate States and Britain, we have yet to enter any war.  The public is beginning to lose confidence in our ability to lead the country, and if we dont act soon we may be voted out of office."
 wsv_usa.10.a:0 "We should probably act soon"
 wsv_usa.11.t:0 "The 1916 Election"
 wsv_usa.11.d:0 "The 1916 election is here... and the United States isn't at war.  Well the Socialists have only been growing in power, and due to the Democrats failing to deliver the vegenance so sought by the American people, it seems like its time for a change in leadership."
 wsv_usa.11:0 "The Socialist come to power"
 wsv_usa.12.t:0 "Eugene V. Debs Becomes President of the United States"
 wsv_usa.12.d:0 "In a stunning upset, the Socialist candidate Eugene V. Debs has won the presidency of the United States.  An ardent opponent of war, Debs has repeatedly promised that once in office he will avoid war with the Entente. Undoubtedly the ascension of the Socialists to power in the United States will prevent any offensive American war in the future."
 wsv_usa.12.a:0 "Why were you sitting on your butt?"
 wsv_usa.12.b:0 "An interesting turn of events"
 wsv_usa.14.t:0 "Socialist Opposition to the War"
 wsv_usa.14.d:0 "Although the majority of the Socialist Party has agreed to support the war effort for now, some of its more radical members have refused to do so.  They have called our war 'imperialist' and vow to oppose our efforts in Congress."
 wsv_usa.14.a:0 "They may become an issue"
 wsv_usa.15.t:0 "Riot in NYC on Rememberance Day"
 wsv_usa.15.d:0 "With the outbreak of the war, Rememberance Day this year was particularly tense.  However in New York City emotions came to a boil when socialist activists staged an anti-war protest at the same time as the Remeberance parade.  Enraged, local onlookers attacked the protestors, and brawl eventually devolved into a general mayhem spanning several city blocks.  New York police were deployed in force to quell the fighting, and scores of socialists were arrested."
 wsv_usa.15.a:0 "What a mess"
 wsv_usa.16.t:0 "Anti-War Demonstations"
 wsv_usa.16.d:0 "With the war dragging on and the casualty list growing every day, citizens--particularly Socialist ones--have begun calling for a diplomatic exit to the war.  Although these type of demonstrations can be seen in other nations, their existence here is troubling."
 wsv_usa.16.a:0 "Have a spine cowards"
 wsv_usa.17.t:0 "1916 Presidential Election"
 wsv_usa.17.d:0 "The ongoing war makes the 1916 election a cruical one.  With the Democrats in favor of continuing the war on one side, and the Socialists advocating for a just peace on the other, whoever wins this election could determine whether the United States comes out of this war victorious--or defeated."

 wsv_usa.18.d:0 "The Socialist calls for an end to the war have grown louder and louder.  Now they have decided to block funds to the military in an effort to force our hand to the negociating table with the Confederates."
 wsv_usa.18.a:0 "Perhaps we can appease them somehow.."
 wsv_usa.20.t:0 "Eugene V. Debs Becomes President of the United States"
 wsv_usa.20.d:0 "In a stunning upset, the Socialist candidate Eugene V. Debs has won the presidency of the United States.  An ardent opponent of the war, Debs has repeatedly promised that once in office he will end the war with the Confederate States.  Whether he carries through on his promise is to be seen, but undoubtedly the ascension of the Socialists to power in the United States will seriously undermine the American war effort."
 wsv_usa.20.a:0 "A catastrophe"
 wsv_usa.20.b:0 "An interesting turn of events"
 wsv_usa.21.t:0 "Begin Peace Negociations with the Confederates"
 wsv_usa.21.d:0 "Now that the new administration has fully taken power, it is time to end this wretched war and begin peace negociations with the Confederates. Hopefully they will accept a peace with honor."

 wsv_usa.22.t:0 "United States Sends a Peace Offer"
 wsv_usa.22.d:0 "The Socialist administration of [USA.GetLeader] has sent us an offer of peace.  They are asking for 'peace without annexations', and suggest that our two countries return to a 'status quo ante bellum'. They emphasizes that they cannot accept a punitive peace, but hope that our two countries can come to an agreement for a 'peace with honor'."

 wsv_usa.23.t:0 "Confederates Respond with Peace Terms"
 wsv_usa.23.d:0 "The Confederates have responded with their terms. They expect to be given Appalachia and the Missouri Tip as border corrections.  They also demand we demilitarize Maryland and accept their control over Haiti, the Carribean, and Mexico."
 wsv_usa.23.a:0 "Very well"
 wsv_usa.23.b:0 "We cannot accept this"
 wsv_usa.24.t:0 "Peace with Honor in North America"
 wsv_usa.24.d:0 "As a key point of his campaign, Socialist President Eugene V. Debs of the United States promises to bring an end to the war in North America.  Now he has done just that, signing essentially a 'status quo ante bellum' peace with the Confederate States. Although the United States made some minor border concessions and also recognized Confederate dominion over Latin America, Eugene V. Debs is calling the treaty a 'peace with honor' and vows to soon normalize relations with the Entente."
 wsv_usa.24.a:0 "At least the war is over"
 wsv_usa.25.t:0 "Confederate Reject Peace Talks"
 wsv_usa.25.d:0 "The Confederates have refused to hold peace talks with us. It seems this war will only end through blood and steel."
 wsv_usa.25.a:0 "So be it"
 wsv_usa.26.t:0 "Peace Talks Fail in North America"
 wsv_usa.26.d:0 "The Socialist administration of the United States has attempted to secure a 'status quo ante bellum' peace with the Confederate States, on the idea that it would be a 'peace with honor' for both.  However the two sides were unable to come to an agreement on the proposal, and talks seem to have concluded as warfare resumes in North America."
 wsv_usa.26.a:0 "So much for peace"
 wsv_usa.50.t:0 "Split of the American Socialist Party"
 wsv_usa.50.d:0 "We have recieved a troubling report that the American Socialist Party has officially split in two--with its more militant members flocking to the newly formed American Communist Party under C. E. Ruthenberg. It seems the more moderate wing of the party--which held its militant members in check for so long--has finally given way."
 wsv_usa.50.a:0 "Trouble is brewing"
 wsv_usa.51.t:0 "Communist Militants Organizing"
 wsv_usa.51.d:0 "Federal police have raided a warehouse that was occupied by Communist militants.  In the warehouse was found caches of arms, communist literature, and war preparations.  It seems the Communists are organizing for a revolution."
 wsv_usa.51.a:0 "Troubling news"
 wsv_usa.55.t:0 "Communist Revolution in United States"
 wsv_usa.55.d:0 "Shocking news is coming from the United States, where workers in New York City have taken up arms and seized several blocks of the city, proclaiming the formation of a new Communist government.  Although the U.S. Army is insiting the situation is under control, reports indicate that workers across other American cities are following suite, and that even army personel are deserting the front.  The Socialist Party of America meanwhile has denounced the violence and called for a peaceful revolution, but the newly formed Communists are ignoring their pleas."
 wsv_usa.55.a:0 "A catastrophe"
 wsv_usa.56.t:0 "Revolution Erupts in the Rustbelt"

#  wsv_usa.3.t:0 "Overtures to the Socialists"
#  wsv_usa.3.d:0 "Although many in the Democrat party favor a hardline approach against the Socialists and the labor movement, Theodore Roosevelt is known to have a much more sympathetic opinin.  It is hoped that his populist sentiments will be able to bridge the gap between the Democrats and Socialists, so that compromise can be made and the country can move forward."
#  wsv_usa.3.a:0 "Lets see how reasonable these Socialists are"
#  wsv_usa.4.t:0 "Workers' Bill of Rights Passed"
#  wsv_usa.4.d:0 "The Socialist movement has won a great victory with the passage of the Worker's Bill of Rights.  Moving foward, workers will have an eight hour work day, be entitled to backpay and overtime compensation, and will have greatly strengthened union rights.  Although this will undoubtedly decrease economic productivity, it is hoped that the passage of the bill will ease tensions between the government and the working classes for the years to come."

#  wsv_usa.5.t:0 "Socialists Effectively Sidelined"
#  wsv_usa.5.d:0 "Through deft political manuvering and a broad expansion of the powers of the Presidential Decree, President Wood has managed to sideline most of the Socialist opposition.  Although they still mantain significant representation in Congress on paper, in reality now President Woods and the Democrats call the shots."

Composed of citizen militas, they are tasked with readying their communities for military service and mantaining stability.  The Socialists hav decried these as nothing more than armed thugs however, and there are rumors that socialist militas have begun to form as well."

#  wsv_usa.11.d:0 "With another election on hand, it is time to reevaluate the current administration.  Although there are calls for a change in leadership, the people are content that we have remained out of war so far.  Perhaps a stead course is the best choice.  Then again, perhaps a Socialist administration is what we need."

#  wsv_usa.13.t:0 "The Upcoming Election"
#  wsv_usa.13.d:0 "The longer-than-expected duration of the war has turned large swathes of the populace against us.  Moreover, our heavy handed treatment of the Socialists has only strengthened their cries for a new administration.  These two factors mean that it is unlikely we will win the upcoming election---unless we suspend it all together.  It is a drastic movement, and one surely to cause trouble in the near future, but it is the only way to mantain our grip on power..."

#  wsv_usa.14.t:0 "Elections Suspended in the United States"
#  wsv_usa.14.d:0 "Citing the ongoing war and the growing threat of Socialist militants, President Leonard Wood has announced the suspension of the 1916 U.S. Presidential Election.  Although he promises to hold the election once the war is over, this move has been met with extreme condemnation from the Socialists, who decry Wood as a dictator in all but name.  The Democrat Party meanwhile is split on the matter, but most of the party seems to be at least quietly supporting Wood.  Nevertheless, President Wood has dispatched Federal troops to the capitols of all the states in the nation, to ensure order is mantained.  It seems the United States is heading for dark times."

wsv_historical_treaty.0.d:0 "Welcome to World of a Southern Victory!  This mod is a game adaptation of Harry Turtledove’s epic novels in the “Southern Victory Series,” and is made to mirror the events of the novels as closely as possible, including the historical peace deals of the series.  However as we recognize that some players may want more freedom in the peace deals, you have the ability to turn them on or off here before the game begins (although this is not recommended for WW1, due to it being a very stagnant war).  Keep in mind that leaving the peace deals enabled still allows you to reject them if you wish, however the AI will always accept them (so if AI France sends Germany a peace deal, AI Germany will always accept, but if you control Germany you can refuse it and continue the war).  If you are playing multiplayer, the canonical peace deals will only turn on if the majority of the players select “yes.”\n\nAlso note that for maximum canonicalness, you must turn on canonical focuses, as not doing so will give the AI freedom to be random.\n\nThank you for playing “World of a Southern Victory,” we hope you enjoy."
