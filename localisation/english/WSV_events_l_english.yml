 wsv_intro.1.t:0 "Introduction" 
 wsv_intro.1.d:0 "Welcome to World of a Southern Victory!  This mod is an adaptation of Harry Turtledove’s “Southern Victory” series, and attempts to replicate the canonical events of the series while also giving players some flexibility in how events play out.  Keep in mind that due to being a one-man team, I have had to focus my efforts on developing content for North America, and have thus neglected aspects of the European nations.  Furthermore, as there is already a World War II mod for Southern Victory, I focused my work more on the Great War section of this mod.  However, I hope to be able to create content for Europe and the Second Great War some time in the future.\n\nI would also like to acknowledge the Wolferos Great War mod, on which this mod is built upon, as well as Kaiserreich, Road to 56, and the Great War Redux, which I have taken some content and ideas from."

 wsv_intro.2.t:0 "Scripted Peace Deals" 
 wsv_intro.2.d:0 "In order to mirror the events of the novels as closely as possible, I have included the canonical peace deals of the series for the Great War.  Although I understand these may limit the freedom of the players, I felt it was the best way to represent the series in game.  However, to maintain flexibility, I have also included an alt-alt history peace deal for the Confederacy winning in the Great War, as well as the OTL peace deals of World War I for the Central Powers.  In the future I hope to expand these peace deals into the Second Great War."

 wsv_intro.3.t:0 "A Note on Deals" 
 wsv_intro.3.d:0 "Due to the being a one-man team, this mod is not compatible with most DLCS.  Specifically, it is NOT compatible with either La Resistance, Man the Guns, No Step Back, and By Blood Alone.  Thus, if you see tech issues with either tanks, the aircraft, or navy, you likely have one of these DLCS enabled.  The other HoI4 DLCS (Waking the Tiger, Death Before Dishonor, and Together for Victory) may work with the mod, but compatibility is not guaranteed."

 wsv_usa.1.d:0 "As another April 22 dawns, the United States once again mourns the day of Remembrance.  All across the nations, solemn parades are held, the American flag waving upside down to mark the distress of the people.  Hundreds of thousands of men in uniform march silently; behind them the veterans of the Second Mexican War and the War of Secession follow.  For those outside the U.S. these yearly parades have become a strange almost cult-like ritual.  But for the American people, it is a reminder of what has been lost, and a promise of retribution against those who took it."

wsv_historical_treaty.0.d:0 "Welcome to World of a Southern Victory!  This mod is a game adaptation of Harry Turtledove’s epic novels in the “Southern Victory Series,” and is made to mirror the events of the novels as closely as possible, including the historical peace deals of the series.  However as we recognize that some players may want more freedom in the peace deals, you have the ability to turn them on or off here before the game begins (although this is not recommended for WW1, due to it being a very stagnant war).  Keep in mind that leaving the peace deals enabled still allows you to reject them if you wish, however the AI will always accept them (so if AI France sends Germany a peace deal, AI Germany will always accept, but if you control Germany you can refuse it and continue the war).  If you are playing multiplayer, the canonical peace deals will only turn on if the majority of the players select “yes.”\n\nAlso note that for maximum canonicalness, you must turn on canonical focuses, as not doing so will give the AI freedom to be random.\n\nThank you for playing “World of a Southern Victory,” we hope you enjoy."
