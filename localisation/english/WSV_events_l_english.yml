 # Intro
 wsv_intro.1.t:0 "Introduction" 
 wsv_intro.1.d:0 "Welcome to World of a Southern Victory!  This mod is an adaptation of Harry Turtledove’s “Southern Victory” series, and attempts to replicate the canonical events of the series while also giving players some flexibility in how events play out.  Keep in mind that due to being a one-man team, I have had to focus my efforts on developing content for North America, and have thus neglected aspects of the European nations.  Furthermore, as there is already a World War II mod for Southern Victory, I focused my work more on the Great War section of this mod.  However, I hope to be able to create content for Europe and the Second Great War some time in the future.\n\nI would also like to acknowledge the Wolferos Great War mod, on which this mod is built upon, as well as Kaiserreich, Road to 56, and the Great War Redux, which I have taken some content and ideas from."

 wsv_intro.2.t:0 "Scripted Peace Deals" 
 wsv_intro.2.d:0 "In order to mirror the events of the novels as closely as possible, I have included the canonical peace deals of the series for the Great War.  Although I understand these may limit the freedom of the players, I felt it was the best way to represent the series in game.  However, to maintain flexibility, I have also included an alt-alt history peace deal for the Confederacy winning in the Great War, as well as the OTL peace deals of World War I for the Central Powers.  In the future I hope to expand these peace deals into the Second Great War."

 wsv_intro.3.t:0 "A Note on Deals" 
 wsv_intro.3.d:0 "Due to the being a one-man team, this mod is not compatible with most DLCS.  Specifically, it is NOT compatible with either La Resistance, Man the Guns, No Step Back, and By Blood Alone.  Thus, if you see tech issues with either tanks, the aircraft, or navy, you likely have one of these DLCS enabled.  The other HoI4 DLCS (Waking the Tiger, Death Before Dishonor, and Together for Victory) may work with the mod, but compatibility is not guaranteed." 
 wsv_intro.3.a:0 "Understood, lets get started!"  



 # USA
 wsv_usa.1.t:0 "Remembrance Day"
 wsv_usa.1.d:0 "As another April 22 dawns, the United States once again mourns the day of Remembrance.  All across the nations, solemn parades are held, the American flag waving upside down to mark the distress of the people.  Hundreds of thousands of men in uniform march silently; behind them the veterans of the Second Mexican War and the War of Secession follow.  For those outside the U.S. these yearly parades have become a strange almost cult-like ritual.  But for the American people, it is a reminder of what has been lost, and a promise of retribution against those who took it."
 wsv_usa.1.a:0 "We will avenge that which we have lost"
 wsv_usa.2.t:0 "1912 Presidential Election"
 wsv_usa.2.d:0 "The end of 1912 brings another presidential election.  Although the Socialists have been growing in popularity in recent years, the Democrats are all but assured to win the election.  However, who will lead the Democrat party is a different matter all together.  On one hand there is Theodore Roosevelt, who is by all accounts a true patriot, but nevertheless seeks to work with the socialists in helping the working class.  On the other side is Leonard Wood, who is an even more ardent nationalist than Roosevelt, and holds nothing but contempt for the socialists.  Who should it be...?"
 wsv_usa.2.a:0 "Teddy Roosevelt for President!"
 wsv_usa.2.b:0 "Leonard Wood for President!"
 teddy_becomes_president_tt:0 "§LTeddy Roosevelt becomes the President§!"
 wood_becomes_president_tt:0 "§LLeonard Wood becomes the President§!"
 wsv_usa.3.t:0 "Overtures to the Socialists"
 wsv_usa.3.d:0 "Although many in the Democrat party favor a hardline approach against the Socialists and the labor movement, Theodore Roosevelt is known to have a much more sympathetic opinin.  It is hoped that his populist sentiments will be able to bridge the gap between the Democrats and Socialists, so that compromise can be made and the country can move forward."
 wsv_usa.3.a:0 "Lets see how reasonable these Socialists are"
 wsv_usa.4.t:0 "Workers' Bill of Rights Passed"
 wsv_usa.4.d:0 "The Socialist movement has won a great victory with the passage of the Worker's Bill of Rights.  Moving foward, workers will have an eight hour work day, be entitled to backpay and overtime compensation, and will have greatly strengthened union rights.  Although this will undoubtedly decrease economic productivity, it is hoped that the passage of the bill will ease tensions between the government and the working classes for the years to come."
 wsv_usa.4.a:0 "Sometimes one must compromise"
 wsv_usa.5.t:0 "Socialists Effectively Sidelined"
 wsv_usa.5.d:0 "Through deft political manuvering and a broad expansion of the powers of the Presidential Decree, President Wood has managed to sideline most of the Socialist opposition.  Although they still mantain significant representation in Congress on paper, in reality now President Woods and the Democrats call the shots."
 wsv_usa.5.a:0 "They wont stand in our way"
 wsv_usa.6.t:0 "Formation of American Home Guard"
 wsv_usa.6.d:0 "On decree of President Wood, the American Home Guard has been formed.  Composed of citizen militas, they are tasked with readying their communities for military service and mantaining stability.  The Socialists hav decried these as nothing more than armed thugs however, and there are rumors that socialist militas have begun to form as well."
 wsv_usa.6.a:0 "We must mantain order"
 wsv_usa.7.t:0 "Anti-War Demonstations"
 wsv_usa.7.d:0 "With the war dragging on and the casualty list growing every day, citizens--particularly Socialist ones--have begun calling for a diplomatic exit to the war.  Although these type of demonstrations can be seen in other nations, their existence here is troubling."
 wsv_usa.7.a:0 "Have a spine cowards"
 wsv_usa.10.t:0 "Riot in NYC on Rememberance Day"
 wsv_usa.10.d:0 "With the outbreak of the war, Rememberance Day this year was particularly tense.  However in New York City emotions came to a boil when socialist activists staged an anti-war protest at the same time as the Remeberance parade.  Enraged, local onlookers attacked the protestors, and brawl eventually devolved into a general mayhem spanning several city blocks.  New York police were deployed in force to quell the fighting, and scores of socialists were arrested."
 wsv_usa.10.a:0 "What a mess"
 wsv_usa.11.t:0 "1916 Presidential Election"
 wsv_usa.11.d:0 "With another election on hand, it is time to reevaluate the current administration.  Although there are calls for a change in leadership, the people are content that we have remained out of war so far.  Perhaps a stead course is the best choice.  Then again, perhaps a Socialist administration is what we need."
 wsv_usa.11.a:0 "Mantain a steady course"
 wsv_usa.11.b:0 "Eugene Debs for President!"

 incumbent_remains_president_tt:0 "§LThe incumbent remains President§!"
 wsv_usa.12.t:0 "1916 Presidential Election"
 wsv_usa.12.d:0 "The ongoing war makes the 1916 election a cruical one.  With the Democrats in favor of continuing the war on one side, and the Socialists advocating for a just peace on the other, whoever wins this election could determine whether the United States comes out of this war victorious--or defeated."
 wsv_usa.12.a:0 "Teddy Roosevelt for President!"
 TR_remains_president_tt:0 "§LTheodore Roosevelt remains President§!"
 wsv_usa.13.t:0 "The Upcoming Election"
 wsv_usa.13.d:0 "The longer-than-expected duration of the war has turned large swathes of the populace against us.  Moreover, our heavy handed treatment of the Socialists has only strengthened their cries for a new administration.  These two factors mean that it is unlikely we will win the upcoming election---unless we suspend it all together.  It is a drastic movement, and one surely to cause trouble in the near future, but it is the only way to mantain our grip on power..."
 wsv_usa.13.a:0 "The die is cast"
 wsv_usa.14.t:0 "Elections Suspended in the United States"
 wsv_usa.14.d:0 "Citing the ongoing war and the growing threat of Socialist militants, President Leonard Wood has announced the suspension of the 1916 U.S. Presidential Election.  Although he promises to hold the election once the war is over, this move has been met with extreme condemnation from the Socialists, who decry Wood as a dictator in all but name.  The Democrat Party meanwhile is split on the matter, but most of the party seems to be at least quietly supporting Wood.  Nevertheless, President Wood has dispatched Federal troops to the capitols of all the states in the nation, to ensure order is mantained.  It seems the United States is heading for dark times."
 wsv_usa.14.a:0 "American democracy has fallen..."
 wsv_usa.15.t:0 "Mass Protests For Democracy"
 wsv_usa.15.d:0 "Protestors are gathering in the hundreds of thousands across the nation to protest the suspension of the election.  Ranging from anti-war Socialists to previously staunch Democrats, it seems all of American society has mobilized to protest our actions.  We knew suspending the elections would be unpopular, but never to this degree..."
 wsv_usa.15.a:0 "Send the army to disperse them"
 wsv_usa.16.t:0 "Review the Naval Budget"
 wsv_usa.16.d:0 "The time has come to review the spending allocated for the navy.  Should we splurge on the latest ships and guns, cut back spending drastically, or meet somewhere in the middle?"
 wsv_usa.16.a:0 "Spare no expense!"
 wsv_usa.16.b:0 "A moderate funding should suffice"
 wsv_usa.16.c:0 "We're kind of tight on money..."
 wsv_usa.45.t:0 "The Great Mormon Revolt"
 wsv_usa.45.d:0 "With the USA and CSA locked in a bitter conflict, the Mormoms of Utah have taken the opportunity to rise up against the federal government.  Declaring themselves the independent nation of Deseret, the Mormons have stormed several federal forts and armories in Utah, slaughtering the garrisons and taking the arms stockpiles.  Now they have barricaded themselves inside their cities, preparing for the inevitable wrath of the United States."
 wsv_usa.45.a:0 "Those bastards will pay!"
 wsv_usa.45.b:0 "This could be useful..."
 wsv_usa.45.c:0 "An interesting turn of events"
 wsv_usa.50.t:0 "United States Requests Defense Pact"
 wsv_usa.50.d:0 "With the increasing aggression of the Entente members, the United States has approached us with a proposal for mutual defense.  They propose that the United States and Germany sign a defensive pact, so that if either is attacked by the Entente the other will come to their aid." 
 wsv_usa.50.a:0 "They will be a useful ally"

 wsv_usa.53.t:0 "American-German Defense Pact"
 wsv_usa.53.d:0 "Today, the United States and Germany announced the formation of the American-German Defense Pact. Stated to be 'purely defensive in nature', the pact stipulates that if either of the two countries were to be attacked, the other would come to its aid.  Commentators from the nations of Britain, the Confederate States, and France decried the pact however as a 'aggressive move' designed to threaten the Entente."

 wsv_usa.60.d:0 "In a daring offensive, the United States has engaged the British forces stationed in the Sandwich Islands.  Caught by surprise, the British were unable to prevent the landing of US Marines and Army forces, which have stormed the island of Oahu.  Although clashes are still occuring between the U.S. and British navies, it seems for now that the Sandwich Islands have fallen into the hands of the United States."

 wsv_usa.61.t:0 "Bombings in Canada"
 wsv_usa.61.d:0 "Our occupation of Canada has proven unpopular with the locals, a few of which have taken to planting bombs on our rail lines and in our supply depots. Although a nuisance more than a real threat, the bombings have slowed down our progress up North and has affected the moral of the soldiers stationed there.  We should probably respond in some fashion to these cowardly acts."

 wsv_usa.65.t:0 "The Issue of Mexico"
 wsv_usa.65.d:0 "Our history with Mexico is complex.  Although there is still bad blood over the Mexican-American War, the Mexican are now ruled over by a foriegn European monarch, and are essentially puppets of the Confederate States.  We could attempt to exploit this situation and aid the Mexicans in achieving their liberty.  Alternatively we could just take more of their land..."

He proclaimed that moving forward, the Confederacy would increase military and economic activity in the Caribbean and Central American regions, and would furthermore task itself with defending the countries there from threats--both internal and external.  This last portion--which has already been dubbed the 'Wilsonian Doctrine'--seems to have been left intentionally vague, however observers comment that it is likely a veiled warning at the United States."

wsv_historical_treaty.0.d:0 "Welcome to World of a Southern Victory!  This mod is a game adaptation of Harry Turtledove’s epic novels in the “Southern Victory Series,” and is made to mirror the events of the novels as closely as possible, including the historical peace deals of the series.  However as we recognize that some players may want more freedom in the peace deals, you have the ability to turn them on or off here before the game begins (although this is not recommended for WW1, due to it being a very stagnant war).  Keep in mind that leaving the peace deals enabled still allows you to reject them if you wish, however the AI will always accept them (so if AI France sends Germany a peace deal, AI Germany will always accept, but if you control Germany you can refuse it and continue the war).  If you are playing multiplayer, the canonical peace deals will only turn on if the majority of the players select “yes.”\n\nAlso note that for maximum canonicalness, you must turn on canonical focuses, as not doing so will give the AI freedom to be random.\n\nThank you for playing “World of a Southern Victory,” we hope you enjoy."
