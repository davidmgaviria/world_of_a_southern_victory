 ## Infantry ##
 ww1_helmet_equip:0 "Adopt Helmets"
 ww1_helmet_equip_desc:0 "The hats and leather caps that have been assigned to our infantry are simply no longer suitable for modern warfare, and attempts to simply bolster these types of headware have had limited success. By adopting a new helmet, one made out of steel, we certainly won't be able to stop a bullet with any consistency, but our troops will be able to avoid casual head injuries much more easily."

 motorized_equipment_2:0 "Early Motorized"
 motorized_equipment_2_desc:0 "Motorizing infantry is the first stage towards the mechanization of an army. Civilian trucks are readily adaptable to military uses of transporting soldiers, towing guns, and carrying equipment and supplies. This greatly increases the strategic mobility of infantry units, which would otherwise rely on marching."

 tank_unlocker1_desc:0 "Some of our Artillery captains have proposed an armored artillery tractor for use on the battlefield. While this sort of design is unlikely to go anwhere- or, for that matter, unlikely to even be built yet- it is the first important step to ensuring that these sorts of ideas might one day come into reality."
 tank_unlocker2_desc:0 "While the idea of an armored artillery-carrying vehicle is nothing new, a design capable of doing so would be. Constructing a basic Barrel prototype will likely not lead to any direct results on the battlefield, but a further, more conventional design could easily come out of such a design."
 TANK_UNLOCKER_SPECIAL:0 "The development of a Barrel Prototype is an essential prerequisite for the development of conventional Barrels. This technology must be researched before you can research advanced Barrels."

 ## Naval ##
 ww1_smoke_generator:0 "Naval Smoke Generator"
 ww1_smoke_generator_desc:0 "Warships have sometimes used a simple variation of the smoke generator, by injecting fuel oil directly into the smoke stack. An even simpler method that was used in the days of steam-propelled warships was to restrict the supply of air to the boiler. This resulted in incomplete combustion of the coal or oil, which produced a thick black smoke. Because the smoke was black, it absorbed heat from the sun and tended to rise above the water."

 ww1_oil1:0 "Oil Extraction"
 ww1_oil1_desc:0 "Oil and its uses have been known since the late 19th century, and sadly, most of our oil extraction ability dates much the same. Modernizing our oil wells will increase our take of this valuable substance to a good degree."
 ww1_oil2:0 "Improved Oil Drilling"
 ww1_oil2_desc:0 "Oil is elusive- it hides underground, where none can see it. For this reason, it's imperitive that we develop more efficient ways to locate it. By improving our oil drilling capabilities, we can find and, therefore, exploit more oil around existing reserves."
 ww1_oil3:0 "Oil Worker Training"
 ww1_oil3_desc:0 "With the recent advances in the tools to find and extract oil, we cannot let our workers be the reason our efforts fall behind. By establishing training standards for oil field workers in both the private and public sector, we can make sure less oil is wasted, further bolstering our newfound reserves of black gold."

 ww1_airdefense1:0 "Anti-Aircraft Gun Support I"
 ww1_airdefense1_desc:0 "The advent of aircraft provide a new, quite difficult challenge to deal with when constructing fortification lines. It is a lot more difficult to build around a falling bomb than even, say, an artillery shell. Anti-Aircraft guns, therefore, should be set up to support our forts, and keep them defensible even in the modern war."
 ww1_airdefense2:0 "Anti-Aircraft Gun Support II"
 ww1_airdefense2_desc:0 "With better anti-aircraft guns, we can now defend our forts and cities against the latest threats from the sky."
 ww1_medicine1:0 "New Surgical Instruments"
 ww1_medicine1_desc:0 "The era of surgery being a matter of bonesaws and booze is over, thank god. New instruments like the Hirtz Compass and new techniques for existing instruments like Intravenous Blood Transfusion should help to save several of our boys on the battlefield."
 ww1_medicine2:0 "War Medicine"
 ww1_medicine2_desc:0 "Bullets are not the only deadly force in combat. The grim taxman of death is well known to take his due toll on soldiers, especially in the stagnant Trench Warfare. Ensuring mass production of vitamins, antibiotics, and other chemical cures- and of course, making sure that they all work as intended- will lead to far less easily preventable casualties for our troops."
 ww1_medicine3:0 "Sterilization Effort"
 ww1_medicine3_desc:0 "No, don't worry, we're not starting a national vasectomy campaign. Part of the horror of war is filth- the image of a surgeon arm-deep in a patient with blood from another man on his hands is common, but not good. Ensuring there are appropritate sanitation measures taken for our medics can stop them from doing more harm than good."
 ww1_medicine4:0 "Vaccination Campaign"
 ww1_medicine4_desc:0 "No one enjoys getting a shot, but on the battlefield, being immunized to common diseases could save your life- no sick soldier fights well, after all. Though vaccination is still not yet fully understood, we know enough about the science to know that it's got direct, positive benefits- and who could resist saving more manpower?"
 ww1_medicine5:0 "Hospital Modernization"
 ww1_medicine5_desc:0 "Though our field surgeons are now all well and good, we cannot forget our proper hospitals behind the lines. Ensuring that these men have everything they need to deal with all possible comers suffering afflictions from shell shock to gas wounds, and even, perhaps, perform reconstructive surgery or other wild new techniques, will lead to even more men surviving a close encounter of the front lines."
