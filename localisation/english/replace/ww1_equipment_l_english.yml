 tech_ww1_bayonet1_desc:0 "Prior to the Great War, bayonet doctrine was largely founded upon the concept of "reach". It was logic to use of an extremely long rifle and fixed bayonet, to stab an enemy soldier without having to approach within reach of his opponent's blade. But, due to the reduction in barrel length, the overall "reach" of the new short rifles with attached bayonet was reduced."

 motorized_equipment_2_desc:0 "Motorizing infantry is the first stage towards the mechanization of an army.
