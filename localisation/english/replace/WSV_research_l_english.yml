An even simpler method that was used in the days of steam-propelled warships was to restrict the supply of air to the boiler. This resulted in incomplete combustion of the coal or oil, which produced a thick black smoke. Because the smoke was black, it absorbed heat from the sun and tended to rise above the water."

 ww1_medicine2:0 "War Medicine"
 ww1_medicine2_desc:0 "Bullets are not the only deadly force in combat. The grim taxman of death is well known to take his due toll on soldiers, especially in the stagnant Trench Warfare. Ensuring mass production of vitamins, antibiotics, and other chemical cures- and of course, making sure that they all work as intended- will lead to far less easily preventable casualties for our troops."
 ww1_medicine3:0 "Sterilization Effort"
 ww1_medicine3_desc:0 "No, don't worry, we're not starting a national vasectomy campaign. Part of the horror of war is filth- the image of a surgeon arm-deep in a patient with blood from another man on his hands is common, but not good. Ensuring there are appropritate sanitation measures taken for our medics can stop them from doing more harm than good."
 ww1_medicine4:0 "Vaccination Campaign"
 ww1_medicine4_desc:0 "No one enjoys getting a shot, but on the battlefield, being immunized to common diseases could save your life- no sick soldier fights well, after all. Though vaccination is still not yet fully understood, we know enough about the science to know that it's got direct, positive benefits- and who could resist saving more manpower?"
 ww1_medicine5:0 "Hospital Modernization"
 ww1_medicine5_desc:0 "Though our field surgeons are now all well and good, we cannot forget our proper hospitals behind the lines. Ensuring that these men have everything they need to deal with all possible comers suffering afflictions from shell shock to gas wounds, and even, perhaps, perform reconstructive surgery or other wild new techniques, will lead to even more men surviving a close encounter of the front lines."
 concentrated_industry_desc:0 "Focusing our industrial production to a few key sites will allow us to dramatically improve its efficiency."
 dispersed_industry_desc:0 "By spreading out our industries, we can ensure that it becomes difficult for the enemy to target in times of war."

 oil_plant_desc:0 "A network of factories for synthetic distillation and refining of oil products is the next step towards ensuring the fuel supply for our nation."

 advanced_oil_plant_desc:0 "New experimental purification techniques like hydrotreating can be used in oil manufacturing to greatly improve the final product."
