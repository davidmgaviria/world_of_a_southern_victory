The type quickly proved to have many important advantages. Unlike the Albatros, the Fokker D.VII could dive without any fear of structural failure. The D.VII was also noted for its high maneuverability and ability to climb at high angles of attack, its remarkably docile stall, and its reluctance to spin."
