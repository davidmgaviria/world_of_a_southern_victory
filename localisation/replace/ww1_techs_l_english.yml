 ww1_helmet_equip:0 "Adopt Helmets"
 ww1_helmet_equip_desc:0 "The hats and leather caps that have been assigned to our infantry are simply no longer suitable for modern warfare, and attempts to simply bolster these types of headware have had limited success. By adopting a new helmet, one made out of steel, we certainly won't be able to stop a bullet with any consistency, but our troops will be able to avoid casual head injuries much more easily."

 radio_detection:0 "Radio Detection"
 radio_detection_desc:0 "The development of Y-Range allows using radio waves to detect physical objects. Research is highly secretive, considering the impact these inventions could have on locating units."
 decimetric_radar:0 "Decimetric Y-Range"
 decimetric_radar_desc:0 "Many units rely on the element of surprise for their efficiency. Development of decimetric y-range allows us to deprive them of this advantage."
 improved_decimetric_radar:0 "Improved Decimetric Y-Range"
 improved_decimetric_radar_desc:0 "The use of y-range has already proven crucial, but our decimetric y-range sets are too few to ensure good coverage. Fitting more units with y-range will allow us to maximize our technological edge."
 centimetric_radar:0 "Centimetric Y-Range"
 centimetric_radar_desc:0 "New y-range operating in the microwave bands enable us to detect objects too small for previous y-ranges to pick up."

 advanced_centimetric_radar_desc:0 "Despite our advanced y-ranges, there are still ways for the enemy to avoid detection. New developments like the Pulse-Doppler y-range allows us to eliminate many of these limitations in our equipment."

 ww1_smoke_generator:0 "Naval Smoke Generator"
 ww1_smoke_generator_desc:0 "Warships have sometimes used a simple variation of the smoke generator, by injecting fuel oil directly into the smoke stack. An even simpler method that was used in the days of steam-propelled warships was to restrict the supply of air to the boiler. This resulted in incomplete combustion of the coal or oil, which produced a thick black smoke. Because the smoke was black, it absorbed heat from the sun and tended to rise above the water."

 ww1_camera1:0 "Vest Pocket Camera"
 ww1_camera1_desc:0 "The Vest Pocket Cameras are folding cameras designed for use by the troops for reconaissance purposes, popularized by Eastman-Kodak. Their use of smaller 127 film reels makes them portable enough for anyone to carry and use, and they should be a boon to our ability to report on enemy actions and movements accurately in combat."
 ww1_camera2:0 "Military Camera"
 ww1_camera2_desc:0 "The Pocket Cameras have been a success, but further developments could help further. Improved stabilizers may help troops on horseback or in vehicles, and a camera useful for taking pictures from aircraft could all combine to ensure that the Generals and officers see what the recon sees."
 ww1_camera3:0 "Propaganda Films"
 ww1_camera3_desc:0 "Our widespread use of cameras for the war effort has given us a large amount of talented photographers who often have little to do. Additionally, Motion Picture distribution is becoming simpler. By hiring some of our talented cameramen (and sometimes even women) to make propaganda films celebrating the glory of our nation, we can ensure that our citizens think we're the best damn country in the world."

 ww1_ambulance1:0 "Horse-drawn Ambulance"
 ww1_ambulance1_desc:0 "With the advent of modern horse-drawn vehicles in our army, we're able to standardize an ambulance vehicle, to quickly escort casualties off of the front line and into quick treatment. While they'll surely have a bumpy ride, and the conditions in these carts won't be particularly pleasant, it is surely much better than having wound treatment in the middle of an artillery crater."
 ww1_ambulance2:0 "Motorized Ambulance"
 ww1_ambulance2_desc:0 "Replacing horse-drawn ambulance carts with motor vehicles will allow us to evacuate troops from the battle much more quickly, which will help us save lives when time is of the essence. The improved horsepower vehicles will also allow for smoother rides and the ambulance to carry more supplies more effectively, which will further increase our return on casualties."
 ww1_oil1:0 "Oil Extraction"
 ww1_oil1_desc:0 "Oil and its uses have been known since the late 19th century, and sadly, most of our oil extraction ability dates much the same. Modernizing our oil wells will increase our take of this valuable substance to a good degree."
 ww1_oil2:0 "Improved Oil Drilling"
 ww1_oil2_desc:0 "Oil is elusive- it hides underground, where none can see it. For this reason, it's imperitive that we develop more efficient ways to locate it. By improving our oil drilling capabilities, we can find and, therefore, exploit more oil around existing reserves."
 ww1_oil3:0 "Oil Worker Training"
 ww1_oil3_desc:0 "With the recent advances in the tools to find and extract oil, we cannot let our workers be the reason our efforts fall behind. By establishing training standards for oil field workers in both the private and public sector, we can make sure less oil is wasted, further bolstering our newfound reserves of black gold."

 ww1_fortification1:0 "Vauban's Works on Defense"
 ww1_fortification1_desc:0 "Fortifications seem like a no-brainer to construct, and to a degree, this much is the case. However, effective design and positioning of forts is important to get any serious use out of them, and Vauban's Works, despite being published hundreds of years ago, still ring true to this day. Studying this will allow superior fortification construction."
 ww1_fortification2:0 "Trench Excavation"
 ww1_fortification2_desc:0 "Forts on their own are nice, but in today's Trench Warfare, integrating them into our existing trench systems would be even better. Construction of smaller forts that are interlocked with our trenches will not only give us superior forts, but also give troops in the garrison a far easier way out if need be."
 ww1_fortification3:0 "Reinforced Concrete"
 ww1_fortification3_desc:0 "Even the substance we construct our fortifications out of can still yet be improved. Reinforcing our concrete will lead to more stable, solid fortifications, less vulnerable to enemy artillery strikes."
 ww1_fortification3b:0 "Defensive Bunker I"
 ww1_fortification3b_desc:0 "Forts on their own are good defenses, but there's not much room or time to construct one when the trench line moves up. Bunkers, being smaller and much faster to construct, can help our defensive lines in fortified sectors stay secure."

 ww1_fortification4_desc:0 "The advent of Aircraft provide a new, quite difficult challenge to deal with when constructing fortification lines. It is a lot more difficult to build around a falling bomb than even, say, an artillery shell. Anti-Aircraft guns, therefore, should be set up to support our forts, and keep them defensible even in the modern war."
 ww1_fortification4b:0 "Anti-Aircraft Gun Support II"

 ww1_medicine2:0 "War Medicine"
 ww1_medicine2_desc:0 "Bullets are not the only deadly force in combat. The grim taxman of death is well known to take his due toll on soldiers, especially in the stagnant Trench Warfare. Ensuring mass production of vitamins, antibiotics, and other chemical cures- and of course, making sure that they all work as intended- will lead to far less easily preventable casualties for our troops."
 ww1_medicine3:0 "Sterilization Effort"
 ww1_medicine3_desc:0 "No, don't worry, we're not starting a national vasectomy campaign. Part of the horror of war is filth- the image of a surgeon arm-deep in a patient with blood from another man on his hands is common, but not good. Ensuring there are appropritate sanitation measures taken for our medics can stop them from doing more harm than good."
 ww1_medicine4:0 "Vaccination Campaign"
 ww1_medicine4_desc:0 "No one enjoys getting a shot, but on the battlefield, being immunized to common diseases could save your life- no sick soldier fights well, after all. Though vaccination is still not yet fully understood, we know enough about the science to know that it's got direct, positive benefits- and who could resist saving more manpower?"
 ww1_medicine5:0 "Hospital Modernization"
 ww1_medicine5_desc:0 "Though our field surgeons are now all well and good, we cannot forget our proper hospitals behind the lines. Ensuring that these men have everything they need to deal with all possible comers suffering afflictions from shell shock to gas wounds, and even, perhaps, perform reconstructive surgery or other wild new techniques, will lead to even more men surviving a close encounter of the front lines."
