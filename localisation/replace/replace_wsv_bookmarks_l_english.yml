 # 1910
 POWDERKEG_NAME:0 "The Powderkeg"
 POWDERKEG_DESC:0 "1910 is a challenging time for the peace in the world. The Italians are preparing for a war with the Ottomans, which will threaten their hold in the Balkans. Rebellion in Morocco is beginning to boil over, much to the anguish of France and to the delight of the German Empire. And the USA, still bitter about their defeat thirty years ago in the Second Mexican War, is itching for another go at the Confederacy.  All in all, either clear heads will be needed to keep the peace, or strong hearts to win the war."
 USA_POWDERKEG_DESC:0 "The War of Secession saw the end of the dream that had once been the United States of America.  The remaining states, bitter at France and Britain for their intervention, swore revenge.  Yet in the Second Mexican War the United States once again proved militarily incompetent. \n\nHowever from this lose came a new opportunity, as the nascent German Empire and the United States bonded over common enemies.  Now a member of the Quadruple Alliance, the United States is sure that when the time comes to face the CSA again, they will fall."
 CSA_POWDERKEG_DESC:0 "In 1862, France and Britain came to the rescue of the Confederacy and forced the United States to end hostilities and recognize the Confederate States of America.  Since then, the Confederacy has been a loyal ally of the two European powers, a bond that was further solidified after the Second Mexican War.  \n\nNow, the dominant power of North America, the Confederacy is young and unafraid, confident of both their military and moral superiority.  However much has changed in the past 30 years, and the old enemy in the North is not what it once was."
 FRA_POWDERKEG_DESC:0 "In 1870, France was dealt a blow by the formation of the German Empire in a crushing war which saw the loss of Alsace-Lorraine. This made an implacable enemy of France, who has been licking her wounds since.  To make matters worse, the German Empire has allied itself with the United States of America. \n\nFortunately, French diplomacy has built an Entente Cordial with the United Kingdom, Confederacy, and Russia. When war breaks out, surely the Germans and Americans will crumble. The matter is, of course, ''when''."
 ENG_POWDERKEG_DESC:0 "The British Empire is still at its zenith. Controlling a massive amount of territory in Africa, Asia, and the Americas through both direct rule and dominions, the United Kingdom still has one continent yet to be mastered: Europe. The United Kingdom has a few allies on the mainland, but none they are particularly fond of. \n\nOf course, good king Edward is surely not long for this world, and crown prince George has time to shake things up. What will the next king do for Britannia's place in Europe?"
 GER_POWDERKEG_DESC:0 "What was once 35 different independent nations is now the German Empire, seen by many as one of the world's foremost powers, if not the strongest of them all. However, there are many who would trifle with such a state. The German enemy of France has formed the Quadruple Entente of themselves, the UK, Confederacy, and Russia, all far stronger than Germany's own weak allies in Europe. \n\nFortunately however, Germany has been cultivating a friendship in the West, and hopefully, when the next war comes, that friendship will pay off."
 ITA_POWDERKEG_DESC:0 "Italy is the smallest member of the Quadruple Alliance, an alliance with which she has little faith in. Austria-Hungary, Italy's natural rival, is now a friend in the world of treaties but still a rival in practical terms. After all, Italian Irredentism still decrees the Austrian-held Dalmatian coast as Italian. For now, however, there are more pressing matters. \n\nWar plans with the Ottoman Turks are already being drawn up. The government predicts a short, decisive war. Italy shall prove her power."
 AUH_POWDERKEG_DESC:0 "The last century was a curse to the Austrian throne. Humiliation after humiliation was thrust upon her, from the rampage of Napoleon to the unification of Germany by the Prussians. Venerable old Kaiser Franz Josef now stands as the weakest member of the Triple Alliance, with two of her old enemies. But surprisingly, this has gone well for Austria so far. \n\nThe Hapsburgs have inherited Bosnia, and the people of Hungary finally seem placated. Perhaps more good shall come."
 RUS_POWDERKEG_DESC:0 "Recent years have not been kind to the Russian Empire. With a major military defeat at the hands of Japan, followed by a revolution that forced the once-invincible Tsar into a constitution, the Russian government must get back on its feet and prove its strength again, or risk revolution. \n\nLuckily, the Balkans are turbulent again. The crumbling Ottoman Empire is Russia's opportunity to expand, create new puppet states, and more importantly, prove it is still a world power."
 TUR_POWDERKEG_DESC:0 "Storm clouds are gathering over Kostantiniyye. Serbia, Greece and Bulgaria have been scheming together again- likely a war to try and claim the territory they unrightfully claim is theirs. The Albanians are close to revolt. The Italian government is also very publicly contemplating a conquest of the Tripoli Vilayet. \n\nLoss of territory is nearly inevitable. Ottoman Diplomacy, therefore, should center around ensuring we keep the capital, if nothing else."
 SER_POWDERKEG_DESC:0 "Serbia is seen by outsiders as a backwater, minor nation. Nothing more than a pawn in a great game that the world's empires are playing as each other. Of course, the empires of the world may learn sooner than they think that the Serbs are destined for greater things. \n\nCurrently, most Serbs live outside our borders, in Turkish or Austrian territory. If we are to make a deal with the devil- the Bulgarians- the Serbs may begin their road for glory by way of full Serbian unification."
 BUL_POWDERKEG_DESC:0 "Bulgaria has already made a name for itself through successful conflicts against the Serbs and outmaneuvering the Ottoman Empire to unify with Eastern Rumelia. Of course, now the state stands at a more uncomfortable position. The Turks seem unwilling to put up any more Bulgarian territory for grabs, and the Russians are slowly withdrawing their support. \n\nPerhaps it is not too late to mend fences with Serbia? After all, a Bulgaria with strong friends could be a surprising menace."
 CAN_POWDERKEG_DESC:0 "Although the War of Secession dealt the United States a great blow, it has put Canada in a more precarious position than ever.  Now Canada faces a hostile neighbor in the South, whose is much larger, both in terms of industry and military.  \n\nTrue Canada has a great ally in the form of the Mother Nation, Great Britain, but an ocean stands between the two, and in the event of a war, aid will take a long time to arrive."
 JAP_POWDERKEG_DESC:0 "In just under 50 years, Japan has turned from a backwards despotate ruled by a Shogun to a proper modern Empire, just as powerful as any country Europe has to offer. Emperor Meiji is to thank for it, but sadly he is both old and diseased- and can't possibly live much longer. \n\nBefore Crown Prince Yoshihito takes the crown, there are a few more matters to settle, however. The elderly emperor must decide where Japan stands with Russia, and what to do with the Korean vassal."
 BEL_POWDERKEG_DESC:0 "Protected by the British, seen by the German as a backdoor leading to Paris avoiding the fortified French military's concentration along the Franco-German border, the Kingdom of Belgium is in a tricky situation.\n\nKing Albert I will have a difficult choice to make, either stand against the Kaiser Wilhelm II and stood side by side with Entente or either let the German troops walk in its territories and take a different course of action."
 HOL_POWDERKEG_DESC:0 "Since the Second Hague Conference in 1907, the Netherlands do everything to avoid a Political Alliance with another European Empire.\n\nAs the drums of war resound to the gates of Amsterdam and despite their strong policy of neutrality, the peaceful mill country could soon find itself back to the wall having to make a choice that could forever change the future of the Dutch Empire.\n\nNo one knows how the fiercely patriotic Queen Wilhelmina will react..."

 SCHLIEFFEN_NAME:0 "The Great War"
 SCHLIEFFEN_DESC:0 "The drums of war are beating fervently. In the next year, a war is expected to break out between, at the very least, France and Russia vs. Germany and Austria-Hungary. If more powers end up getting involved, the conflict could be the largest war the world's ever seen. One thing is certain: for many countries, their very existence is on the line."
 USA_SCHLIEFFEN_DESC:0 "The United States has been preparing for 30 years for the next show down with its mortal adversary, the CSA.  Now, as Europe draws ever closer to war, the time may come for the USA to strike back at its enemies and reclaim its honor.  \n\nWarfare has changed greatly in the past 30 years though, and the next war that wracks the North American continent will be far deadlier and far more devastating than any before."
 CSA_SCHLIEFFEN_DESC:0 "The Northern Threat is growing ever strong.  Although the CSA has rapidly industrialized over the past 30 years, it is still dwarfed by the giant that is the USA.  Furthermore, Europe seems to be inching towards war, and Britain and France, that have always protected the CSA, may soon be preoccupied in a European War.  \n\nIf the worst comes to past and the USA chooses to strike during a European conflagration, will the CSA be able to hold off the Yankee horde on their own? "
 FRA_SCHLIEFFEN_DESC:0 "France's revanche is soon at hand. The return of the Tricolor to Alsace-Lorraine and the rightful French territory owned by the Germans in Africa, seems nearer than ever. Of course, the Germans are just as ready to strike, but France's time to prove a lesson learned is now. \n\nAfter all, surely all that will be needed is the French Élan that was missing from the last war, and the Germans will be sent packing. Of course, there's rumors a long war could be to our disadvantage, but rumors aren't always true, are they?"
 ENG_SCHLIEFFEN_DESC:0 "The situation in Europe has become too much to bear. Germany and France are both far too close to Britain's position for the comfort of the British public. The Kaiser even has the gall to challenge the Royal Navy's dominance. When the war all fear is to come, something simply must be done. Or must it? \n\nThere is the option to let France and Germany grind each other down and build ourselves up. Of course, British troops MUST get involved if Germany- or France, perhaps- end up attacking any British allies..."
 GER_SCHLIEFFEN_DESC:0 "Herr von Bismarck's prediction that the next war will start with a spark from the powder keg of the Balkans seems to be further and further approaching reality. With all of the tension stemming from the region, there's no doubt a war between German and French alliances will break out soon. Germany, therefore, must be prepared. \n\nThe time for diplomacy is over. The German Army must be readied for what could be a long, gruesome, and, worst of all, two-front war."
 AUH_SCHLIEFFEN_DESC:0 "Austria-Hungary is a resilient state, and has survived much hardship where other states would be destroyed. Yet, the increasing support for Panslavism in Russia combined with the fervor for war in the Balkans poses a threat that may very well spell the end of the Hapsburg rule. Worse yet, the rivalry with the Italians has started again in earnest. \n\nAustria must quell the fury of the Balkan states and stand with Germany against her enemies, or the Empire may become just a cherished memory."
 RUS_SCHLIEFFEN_DESC:0 "The Balkan Wars did little to calm the people of the Russian Empire. Though Russia had thrown their support behind the South Slavic powers, only Serbia and Montenegro are loyal to the empire of the east, and crisis is on the horizon if things don't change- and now. Serbian extremists have proposed trying to break a war out with Austria-Hungary, and this is exactly what Russia needs. \n\nThe clear goals of German Poland and the Slavic lands in Austria are in Russia's sights."
 ITA_SCHLIEFFEN_DESC:0 "22 years ago, Italy halfheartedly joined the Triple Alliance with Germany and the hated Austrians to spite France's gains in Tunisia. Today, the alliance is the most shaky in Europe. With her old alliance, Italy has the chance to get Savoy, Nice, Corsica, and Tunisia for herself. However, the Entente would provide the Dalmatian coast- and seems much more able to do so. \n\nItaly still has time before the war to make a decision. But on which side does her fate lay?"
 TUR_SCHLIEFFEN_DESC:0 "What was once the world's greatest empire has now fallen to near ruin. The Sultanate is no longer considered a major power in Europe, and the carving of Turkey between all of the European powers is a constant threat that crawls closer and closer to reality. To make matters worse, the incompetent Enver Pasha has seized effective control of the government. \n\nThe best course of action, according to the Porte, is to draw close to Germany, and hope their mighty army can protect us in our time of need."
 SER_SCHLIEFFEN_DESC:0 "The Balkan Wars saw a massive success for Serbia, as well as their most important ally in Greece. The hard part, however has just begun: The Habsburgs still hold the region of Bosnia, as well as other South Slavic territories. Worse yet, they see Serbia as a troublemaker, and would be more than happy to rid the world of the state at a moment's notice. \n\nFortunately, Russia seems to have taken a liking to Serbia, though perhaps for malicious reasons. If Tsar Peter utilizes this, the world may change forever..."
 CAN_SCHLIEFFEN_DESC:0 "Although a weak nation, Canada has always relied on the Mother Country’s strength for security.  Now however Europe is seemingly headed towards war and before long the Mother Country may be too preoccupied to help Canada.  To make matters worse, the USA has grown strong, and is hungry for revenge.  \n\n If Canada is to survive the coming years, it must fight tooth and nail."
 BUL_SCHLIEFFEN_DESC:0 "Bulgaria was wrong to trust the Greeks and the Romanians to stay out of the inevitable conflict between themselves and Serbia, and are down to the lowest territorial extent since independence from the Ottoman Empire. It is unlikely they will be fooled twice. Russia seems next in the line of false friends, seeking only to profit from the state. \n\nThe only countries that seem to genuinely have Bulgaria's best interests at heart are Germany and Austria. Perhaps it's time for a new alliance?"
 JAP_SCHLIEFFEN_DESC:0 "Unfortunately, it turns out Emperor Taisho is cursed with mental afflictions which have severely impacted his ability to rule. Fortunately for Japan, his ministers and other members of the Imperial court have begun to administrate Japan, whose public is getting its first taste of liberty. \n\nBut still, what of the war in Europe? Would it be to Japan's benefit to throw in? After all, the British-Japanese alliance is tenuous at best, and Japan may be better off simply waiting to choose which side will serve its interests."
 BEL_SCHLIEFFEN_DESC:0 "Protected by the British, seen by the German as a backdoor leading to Paris avoiding the fortified French military's concentration along the Franco-German border, the Kingdom of Belgium is in a tricky situation.\n\nKing Albert I will have a difficult choice to make, either stand against the Kaiser Wilhelm II and stood side by side with Entente or either let the German troops walk in its territories and take a different course of action."
 HOL_SCHLIEFFEN_DESC:0 "Since the Second Hague Conference in 1907, the Netherlands do everything to avoid a Political Alliance with another European Empire.\n\nAs the drums of war resound to the gates of Amsterdam and despite their strong policy of neutrality, the peaceful mill country could soon find itself back to the wall having to make a choice that could forever change the future of the Dutch Empire.\n\nNo one knows how the fiercely patriotic Queen Wilhelmina will react..."

 GATHERING_STORM_NAME:0 "The Gathering Storm"
 GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "The War to End All Wars was suppose to be just that, the last war.  However, since the fragile Armistice of 1917, these foolish beliefs have fallen away.  In Europe, England and France chafe under the German yolk, and have begun to test their limits.  In Asia, Japan has attacked China, beginning a long and brutal war.  And in North America, Jake Featherstone, a vitrolic war-mongerer and white supremacist, has won the Presidency through... unorthodox means, and many believe he may try to further increase his power."
 USA_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "The Great War saw the United States finally return to dominance on its continent, swallowing up the Dominion of Canada and ripping large chunks out of the Confederate States of America.   However, this new empire came at a cost, and ever since the US has been struggling to put down rebellions across it new holdings.\n\nIn addition, the people of the US have become complacent, allowing their military to fall into decay as social programs took the forefront under the new Socialist administrations.  If another war were to come, the US will find itself vastly unprepared."
 CSA_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Bloodied and battered from the Great War, the Confederate States spent the early post-war years struggling with hyper-inflation, unemployment, and a sense of lost honor.  Into this scene step the Freedom Party, and its charismatic leader Jake Featherstone has promised to restore the Confederacy to its former glory.\n\nNow in power, Featherstone has moved quickly to consolidate his power, abolishing the Supreme Court and purging political opponents.  How he will deal with the upcoming election of 1940, and whether he will attempt to regain the Confederacy’s lost land, is yet to be seen."
 FRA_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "The Great War proved to be as disastrous as the Franco-Prussian War.  Over a million Frenchmen were slain, and in the end France had nothing to show for it but more lost land.\n\nThe French people are furious, and demand action.  If France is to survive, a strong government must rule.  At the same time, the public faith in the French Army is shockingly low, and if France is to ever defeat Germany, then it must fully reinvent the way it wages war."
 ENG_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Once the undisputed world power, the Great Britain has now fallen second place to the German Empire.  While Britain does retain sizeable holdings in Africa and Asia, its grip on the European continent has been shattered, and that’s not to mention the loss of Canada.\n\nIf Britain is to restore its rightful place in the sun, it must fully prepare itself for the next war, so that when it comes the British may reign supreme on the land, air, and sea."
 GER_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "The German Empire has finally achieved its dream of hegemony on the European continent.  In the west, France and Belgium remain under the German heel, while in the east, large swathes of fertile land have been ripped from Russia, regifted to the German people to help them expand and prosper.\n\nHowever, not all is as well as it seems.  The Austro-Hungarian Empire, while still intact, teeters on the edge of collapse.  And outside the German sphere, the former Entente powers are slowly rearming, indicating another far larger and bloodier war may soon be at hand."
 AUH_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Although it staved off defeat and internal collapse during the Great War, the Austro-Hungarian Empire remains a shadow of its former self.  Across the empire, ethnic minorities yearn for freedom, and in Vienna, the Prussian hand encroaches further and further into Austrian affairs.\n\nWorst off, it seems that Russia has not given up on the idea of Panslavism, and is gearing up for another war.  If Austria-Hungary is to survive the coming years, drastic measures must be taken."
 RUS_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "From 1914-1926, Russia was engulfed in endless war.  First against the German Empire, and then against the Bolshevik forces, the brave soldiers of the Tsar fought tooth and nail to stave off destruction.  Even then, they were unable to prevent the lost of large swathes of Eastern Russia to the Germans, which has left Russia weakened and isolated from its slavic brothers in Europe. \n\nNevertheless, the Tsar has not given up on the dream of Panslavism and although Russia is in a worse position than it was 35 years ago, the Tsar has no doubt that this time, the Russian Empire will emerge victorious."
