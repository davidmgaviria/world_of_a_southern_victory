wsv_historical_treaty.0.t:0 "Introduction"
wsv_historical_treaty.0.d:0 "Welcome to World of a Southern Victory!  This mod is a game adaptation of Harry Turtledove’s epic novels in the “Southern Victory Series,” and is made to mirror the events of the novels as closely as possible, including the historical peace deals of the series.  However as we recognize that some players may want more freedom in the peace deals, you have the ability to turn them on or off here before the game begins (although this is not recommended for WW1, due to it being a very stagnant war).  Keep in mind that leaving the peace deals enabled still allows you to reject them if you wish, however the AI will always accept them (so if AI France sends Germany a peace deal, AI Germany will always accept, but if you control Germany you can refuse it and continue the war).  If you are playing multiplayer, the canonical peace deals will only turn on if the majority of the players select “yes.”\n\nAlso note that for maximum canonicalness, you must turn on canonical focuses, as not doing so will give the AI freedom to be random.\n\nThank you for playing “World of a Southern Victory,” we hope you enjoy."
