Version 2.4.0 - Great War Rework

Welcome to World of a Southern Victory! This mod is based off Harry Turtledove's Southern Victory series, and attempts to be a canonically accurate as possible to the novels. In this world, the Confederate States make good their attempt to secede from the Union, defeating the North with the help of Britain and France by 1862. The US, bitter from their defeat, turn to the fledgling German Empire in the following decades, and allies themselves against the Confederates, British, and French.

To fully immerse yourself into the novels, make sure to turn on canonical AI. Note that there are un-canonical focuses, so turning off canonical AI will allow the AI to choose these.


Currently Supported Languages:
-English

Current Features:
-Fully playable 1910
-Unique focus trees for the US, CSA, UK, France, Germany, Russia, and Canada
-Unique tech tree
-Unique model skins for major countries

And more!

Developer's Note:
I made this mod solely because I enjoy programming and absolutely love the Southern Victory series. I have made this in my free time as a hobby, and have released it to the general public in the hopes that other fans of Southern Victory and HoI4 players in general can enjoy the mod. However I am only one person, and while I have tested the mod and tried to catch as many errors and bugs as I can, it is possible some remain. These should be minor and not game breaking, but in any case if you find any please report them to the Bugs section. Also although I have done extensive research for Southern Victory and tried to make it a close to the novels as possible, there are some aspects I may have missed, or some that I was simply unable to do due to the constraints of HoI4. If I did make a glaring errors however such as using an incorrect leader, or if you know more knowledge about the novels that you wish me to add to the game, please write it in the Novelization section. In particular if you know any good quotes, make sure to write these down, so I can add them to the loading quotes!
