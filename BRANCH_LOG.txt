Possible Conflicts: All Great War rework updates

Purpose: This branch is a back-up for current mod on the workshop, which is version 2.3.0. No work is to be done on it unless
for the purpose of updating the version on the workshop.  All Great War rework changes are to be added to the main branch. 
Although the branch was created 1/2024, the files date back from 10/2023, hence the effective date.  Note that although
Patch 1.13 is here, I never uploaded the patch (due to wanting to play-test).
