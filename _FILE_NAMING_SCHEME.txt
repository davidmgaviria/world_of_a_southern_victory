### FILE NAMING SCHEME ###
#Due to the need to modify, override, or outright silence certain vanilla game files, the following file naming scheme has been developed to keep things organized.  
#For all subfolders, unless a folder contains a '_UPDATED_FILE_NAMING' file, the following rules apply.

#1) All files that do not start with an underscore are silencer files (ie. they are empty and meant to override the base game).
#2) All files starting with '_ww1' pertain to content from the Great War mod by Wolferos.
#3) All files starting with '_wsv' pertain 'World of a Southern Victory' content.
