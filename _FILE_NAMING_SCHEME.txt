### FILE NAMING SCHEME ###
#In order to keep things organized, the following naming scheme has been developed and applies to all files in the commons, event, and interface folders.

#1) All files starting with 'ww1' pertain to content from the Great War mod by Wolferos.
#2) All files starting with 'wsv' pertain 'World of a Southern Victory' content.
#3) All files that do not meet either of the above points are files from the vanilla game, and override the base game files.  Make sure to keep files like this to a minimum, and instead use the 'replace_path' feature in the descriptor.mod file in order to ignore large chunks of files.

# The history folder does not follow the above scheme, instead the entire vanilla history folder has been ignored, and so all files there are the 'base files' for the mod.
# The gfx folder also does not follow the above scheme, and instead is simply an addition to the vanilla gfx folder.
